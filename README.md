# Factorion

_(name is a placeholder, plz suggest better ones)_

The goal is to get a computer playing factorio. Or at the very least generating
reasonable factory blueprints when you prompt it. Maybe later we'll augment
this with a different bot that can actually walk around the game and build from
the blueprints suggested by the first bot.

## New Plan

Okay I'm starting to doubt the idea of training an LLM to generate blueprints
from a description. It's not necessarily bad, just won't get to the end game.

We need to go back to generating a full factory, with the inputs being "belt in
here" and "belt out here".

## TODO

- [ ] Get the frame renderer working for pretty videos
- [ ] Integrate with a running factorio instance.
- [ ] Bigger
